*I did this project a while ago but never pushed it to frontend mentor, I found myself overthinking alot and stressing about getting it perfect. I look forward to getting feedback on this project and redoinging this  again once I gain more experience with HTML & CSS. I will try not to stress towards perfection, my main goal is to learn, Thank you for viewing.*
